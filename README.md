### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render questions on page
- Allow user to type in answer
- if answer is correct add the number of points for the question to total score and move on to next question. If incorect show the correct answer and move to the next question.

#### PostMVP 

- Animations
- Add a random daily double question that doubles the score for that question.
- Max time of one minute per question

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Psudocoding | H | 2.5hrs|  |  |
| HTML | H | 1hrs|  |  |
